abstract="In the present paper, microservices, container virtualization and the publish/subscribe messaging paradigm are exploited to develop a distributed, modular, scalable and generic framework for parallelizing population-based metaheuristics. The proposed approach paves the way for an easy deployment of existing metaheuristic algorithms such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) on a scalable runtime environment with full runtime automation. Furthermore, it introduces simple mechanisms to work efficiently with other components like forecasting frameworks and simulators. In order to analyze the feasibility of the design, the EA GLEAM (General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method) is integrated and deployed on a cluster with 4 nodes and 128 cores for benchmarking. The overhead of the framework is measured and the obtained results show not only low values but also a small increase with growing number of computing nodes.",

abstract = "In smart factories, integrated optimisation of manufacturing process planning and scheduling leads to better results than a traditional sequential approach but is computationally more expensive and thus difficult to be applied to real-world manufacturing scenarios. In this paper, a working approach for cloud-based distributed optimisation for process planning and scheduling is presented. Three managers dynamically governing the creation and deletion of subpopulations (islands) evolved by a multi-objective genetic algorithm are proposed, compared and contrasted. A number of test cases based on two real-world manufacturing scenarios are used to show the applicability of the proposed solution."
